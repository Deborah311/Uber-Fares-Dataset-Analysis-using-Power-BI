# 🚖 Uber Fares Dataset Analysis Using Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of the course **Introduction to Big Data Analytics (INSY 8413)** at **AUCA**, instructed by **Mr. Eric Maniraguha**. The objective is to explore and analyze the **Uber Fares Dataset** using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in Uber fares, ride durations, time trends, and other operational insights.

📊 Project Phases
1. Data Preparation in Python
Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Assessed data structure and types

Handled missing values

Removed outliers

Engineered features (hour, day, month, day of week, peak time)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, std. deviation

Outlier detection using box plots

Correlation analysis: fare vs. distance, fare vs. time

Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

3. Power BI Visualization
Imported cleaned dataset

Created visuals for:

Fare distribution

Ride counts by hour, day, month

Time series trends

Geographic ride density (if location data present)

Enabled interactivity with slicers and filters

4. Dashboard Highlights
Time Series Analysis

Hourly and Daily Ride Patterns

Fare Amount Distributions

Drill-down by Weekday or Month

Conditional Formatting and KPIs

📈 Key Insights
Peak ride hours typically occur between 7–9 AM and 5–7 PM

Higher fares are correlated with longer distances

Weekends exhibit higher fare variability

Certain hours show higher ride demand with increased surge pricing
