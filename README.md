# 🚖 Uber Fares Dataset Analysis Using Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of the course **Introduction to Big Data Analytics (INSY 8413)** at **AUCA**, instructed by **Mr. Eric Maniraguha**. The objective is to explore and analyze the **Uber Fares Dataset** using Python for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in Uber fares, ride durations, time trends, and other operational insights.

🎯 Project Objectives

:To analyze Uber fare patterns,ride durations, and temporal trends

💵 Fare distribution

histograms

box plots

🚗 Ride patterns

Hourly

Daily

Monthly

🌦️ Seasonal and 🌍 geographic trends

To highlight busiest periods and, if possible, assess weather impact

To deliver actionable business insights through data storytelling
